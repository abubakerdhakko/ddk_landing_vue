                            DDK uses the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain for its platform. The community members have a democratic voice in deciding who is responsible for processing and managing transactions on the platform. This is done using a unique voting system to achieve consensus - the process of verifying that transaction data is valid based on the general agreement of the trust-elected network

                            Based on the outcome of the voting process, a stakeholder can become a delegate. A delegate is a democratically-elected stakeholder who is given the trusted position to process and manage transactions on the DDK platform. In return for processing transactions, the delegate is rewarded DDKoin(s) because his participation, as delegate, provides the operation (validate and create block) and record of transactions. Delegates digitally sign the transactions on the network. They, (like default stakeholders) also provide security to the network by operating as trusted delegates to process transactions.

                            Delegated Proof of Stake is a fast, secure, and relatively cost-efficient consensus mechanism than other existing algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake as it does not require very high computational power and the mining opportunity depends on the number of votes for the miners from stakeholders. In terms of reward incentives, DPoS incentivize the miners with the transaction fees on validation and block reward on block generation. Unlike DPoS, in PoW, the miner gets reward on block generation while in PoS, the miners only get the block’s pooled transaction fees.
                            <br><br>
                            In DPoS, those who hold the network token are given the opportunity to cast votes to elect block producers. For selecting the block producers, the votes from the stakeholders are weighted by the stakeholder’s stake, and the block producer candidates who receive the most votes are those who become delegates. The delegates are the community members who validate the transactions and add them to the block. On block creation, the delegates get reward. While there are problems with both democracy and corporate governance, one important feature of DPoS that sets it apart from other consensus mechanisms is the open-source nature of these protocols which means that if users disagree, they can fork. The flexible and transparent nature of DPoS makes it useable for entire blockchains or as a consensus algorithm for sidechains, private blockchains, and more. In addition to this, the lower fees, fast confirmations and the potential for increased profitability make the DPoS a perfect democratic consensus mechanism.

                            In POW & POS anyone with mining capability (POW) can join. Anyone with monetary capital may join POS. The difference with DPOS, regardless of capital, one can submit blocks if elected to do so. In DDK, delegates can campaign in forums and convince stakeholders to vote and earn rewards. It depends on the community members to participate in the maintenance, security and growth of the platform. Members’ participation is vital for the benefit of all.

                            If the number of votes for two candidates is equal, then the decision takes place with the amount of stake the voter accounts hold - weight of vote. This makes the DDK DPoS consensus mechanism more efficient because the vote count is considered prior to the vote weight.
